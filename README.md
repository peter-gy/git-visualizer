# GitHub Visualization Tool

All credits for this app go to [Aw Young Qingzhuo](veniversum.me), I just forked and fixed the repo to work without GH access tokens & to make it available through GH pages, as I genuinely believe that this is a cool project, deserving to be accessible to the public in 2022 too.

## What it does

Provides an at-a-glance overview of the repository structure. Finer details can be explored via zooming and tooltips. It makes exploring large and complex projects a breeze.

Files are displayed as a directed graph, color-coded based on file types, and sized accordingly to the length of files.
